# Union Soldier and Regiment Data Scraper for the American Civil War on [Fold3.com](http://fold3.com/)

This code scrapes the [Fold3.com](http://fold3.com/) website for soldier and regiment data of people who fought on the Union side of the American Civil War. The data is given in CSV format, and the code is written in Python.

This data scraper was created for [Federico Masera](https://sites.google.com/site/fgmasera/home) - a Senior Lecturer in Economics at the University of New South Wales, as part of a larger project on analysing the American Civil War.

## Getting Started

To use this code, you will need a premium account for [Fold3.com](http://fold3.com/).

## Output Requirements

Before running the code, ensure that a `data` directory has been created in the main project directory. Within the data directory, create three subdirectories: `csv_out`, `regiment_records`, and `soldier_records`. The scraped data will be saved to these directories in CSV and pickle formats.

## Usage

The code is designed to scrape soldier and regiment data from the website. The data is then saved to files for further analysis.
